# ```Get_Next_Line```
*a 19 Coding School project*

The aim of this project is to create a function that read a file, given as a file descriptor, one line at a time until the end of the file.

## How to use it

> Note: by default, the BUFFER_SIZE variable is set to 32. You can change it using the comman ```-D BUFFER_SIZE=```x when compiling.

No test file is provided but you can try it out with my [GNL_tester](https://github.com/tderwedu/GNL_tester).

## What I have learned

I learned how the ```read``` function works, what are ```file descriptors```, how ```static variables``` work as well as how to use ```buffer``` (vector) to minimize memory to memory copying.
