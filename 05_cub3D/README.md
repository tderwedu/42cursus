# ```cub3D```
*a 19 Coding School project*

This projectâ€™s objectives are information research and to improve skills in graphic design. Ray-casting is used to make a dynamic representation of the inside of a maze from a first person perspective. This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever.
