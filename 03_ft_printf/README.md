# ```ft_printf```
*a 19 Coding School project*

The C ```printf()``` function recoded from scratch.

## How to use it

Clone this repository and execute the following command
```bash
make bonus
```
to generate the librairy file ```libftprintf.a```.

## What's supported

- Flags : ```#```, ```0```, ```-```, ```+```, '``` ```'
- Width : direct decimal integer or as an argument with ```*```
- Precision : direct decimal integer or as an argument with ```*```
- Size : ```hh```, ```h```, ```l```, ```ll```
- Types : ```c```, ```s```, ```u```, ```o```, ```x```, ```X```, ```p```, ```n```, ```d```, ```i```, ```a```, ```A```, ```e```, ```E```, ```f```, ```F```,```g```, ```G```.


## What I have learned

I learned mostly about floating-point numbers called ```double```.  How they are laid in memory and how to convert them back to decimal. What are the special values defined by the ```IEEE 754``` standard and what are the rounding rules.
