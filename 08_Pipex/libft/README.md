# ```libft```
*a 19 Coding School project*  
*v2.00 - Last updated with ft_printf project*

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping essential functions used in C.  
This library will be used in other projects and will therefore be regularly updated.

## How to use it

In order to create the library, simply execute:
```bash
make
```
To use the library with a ```main.c``` file, simply execute:
```bash
gcc main.c -L . -lft
```

## What I learned

This project allows to get familiar with some of the most essential functions in C.
