## The Norm

The norm is a programming standard defining a set of rules to follow when writing C code.  
Most notably:
 - ```For```, ```do ... while``` and ```case``` are forbidden,
 - Each function must have a maximum of _25_ lines,
 - No more than _5_ variables per bloc can be declared.
 
If you are interested in learning more about the norm, feel free to take a look at the PDF included at the root of this repository called ```en.norm.pdf```.
